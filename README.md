# Secure Password Generator
The Secure Password Generator allows users to generate a random, secure password based on their preferences. The password may be customized to include upper or lower case letters, special characters, or numbers, and the user may choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters.

Completing this project gave me a greater understanding of JavaScript functions, especially regarding the relationship between variable accessibility and scope. In the future, I would like to develop a more streamlined, user-friendly interface for entering password preferences.

## Usage Instructions
Once you have opened the [Password Generator](https://dfkestner.github.io/Secure-Password-Generator/) in your browser, click Generate Password. A series of confirmation boxes will appear to determine if you would like to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, or numbers in your password. If you would like your password to include the character type listed, select 'Ok', otherwise select 'Cancel' to proceed to the next option. 

Once all character type criteria has been selected, you will be prompted to enter a preferred password length between 8 and 128 characters. If your entry does not meet the password length requirements, you will receive an error message, and you must select 'Ok' to return to the password length prompt screen. If your entry meets the password length requirements, your generated password will appear in the text box on the page.
